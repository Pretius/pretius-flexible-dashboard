## Free support
Pretius provides free support for the plugins at the GitHub platform. 
We monitor raised issues, prepare fixes, and answer your questions. However, please note that we deliver the plug-ins free of charge, and therefore we will not always be able to help you immediately. 

Interested in better support? 
* [Become a contributor!](#become-a-contributor) We always prioritize the issues raised by our contributors and fix them for free.
* [Consider comercial support.](#comercial-support) Options and benefits are described in the chapter below.

### Bug reporting and change requests
Have you found a bug or have an idea of additional features that the plugin could cover? Firstly, please check the Roadmap and Known issues sections. If your case is not on the lists, please open an issue on a GitHub page following these rules:
* issue should contain login credentials to the application at apex.oracle.com where the problem is reproduced;
* issue should include steps to reproduce the case in the demo application;
* issue should contain description about its nature.

### Implementation issues
If you encounter a problem during the plug-in implementation, please check out our demo application. We do our best to describe each possible use case precisely. If you can not find a solution or your problem is different, contact us: apex-plugins@pretius.com.

## Become a contributor!

Comment one of the opened issues or register a new one, to let others know what you are working on. When you finish, create a new pull request. We will review your code and add the changes to the repository.

By contributing to this repository, you help to build a strong APEX community. We will prioritize any issues raised by you in this and any other plugins.

## Comercial support
We are happy to share our experience for free, but we also realize that sometimes response time, quick implementation, SLA, and instant release for the latest version are crucial. That’s why if you need extended support for our plug-ins, please contact us at apex-plugins@pretius.com.
